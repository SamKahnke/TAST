                  TAST exists to end human trafficking through embracing students, empowering them to raise awareness of trafficking, and educating them on this injustice. Students are sent out to serve in populations impacted by this oppression where students are challenged in their faith and have an opportunity to experience Jesus in a new way.

                  The Spirit of the Sovereign LORD is on me, because the LORD has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoner -Isaiah 61:1

                  Teens Against Sex Trafficking (TAST) is 7 years in the making. The journey began at the end of Kayela's freshman year at Bethel University while leading a chapter of IJM on campus. After volunteering and advocating for anti-trafficking organizations, the Lord called her to direct Teens Against Sex Trafficking as a non profit organization in Sioux Falls, SD. The Lord is faithful in this journey, and students are feeling even more empowered to be the hands and feet of Jesus in a broken world.
